# Python Function:- A block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called.

# There are 2 types of function:-
# 1. Built-in functions:- These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples are:-min(),max(),len(),sum(),type(),range(),dict(),tuple(),list(),print() etc.

# 2. User-defined functions:- We can create function to perform specific tasks as per our needs.

def calculateGmean(a,b):
   Gmean = (a*b)/(a+b)
   print(Gmean)

def isGreater(a,b):
   if(a > b):
      print("First number is greater!!")
   elif(a == b):
      print("Both numbers are equal!!")
   else:
      print("Second number is greater!!")

isGreater(9,18)
