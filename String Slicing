name = "Harry,Shubham"
print(name[0:5])

# Length of the string
print(len(name))

# Let's take another example of String Slicing
fruit = "Mango"
length = len(fruit)
print("Mango is a",length,"letter word")
print(fruit[:4]) # including index 0 but not 4
print(fruit[1:3]) # including index 1 but not 3
print(fruit[0:]) # including index 0 but not 5
print(fruit[0:-2])
print(fruit[-3:-1])
# if [:4] the left side is blank which means python will automatically put the value 0
# also [0:] the right side is blank which means pyhton will automatically put the value of length
# also [0:-2] it works as [0:len(fruit)-2]->
# len(fruit) means it has value 5 because we have taken mango so 5-2 is 3 so it will print Man
# also [-3:-1] means [len(fruit)-3:len(fruit)-1]-> [2:4] which will print nh

# Quick quiz:-
A = "Ankit"
print(A[-4:-2])
