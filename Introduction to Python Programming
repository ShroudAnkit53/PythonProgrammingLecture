# Let's take an example,
A = "Ankit"
B = 'Adarsh'
print("Hi!! My name is",A," and my good friend is",B)
# Accessing characters from a given string:-
# String is just like an array of characters present in it
print(A[0])
print(A[4])
print(B[0])
print(B[5])
# Looping through the string:-
for character in B:
    print(character)
