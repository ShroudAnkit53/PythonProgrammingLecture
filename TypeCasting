# The conversion of one data type to other data type.

a = "23" # It is in string format as double-quote is used
print(a)
b = 9
print(int(a)+b) # Here int(a) is used to convert from string to integer. So, 23 + 9 = 32

print(a+str(b)) # Here str(b) is uded to convert from integer to string. So it will not print 32 but it will print 239

# -> Python supports a wide vareity of functions or methods like: int(),float(),str(),ord(),hex(),oct(),tuple(),set(),list(),dict() etc for the type casting in python.

# Two types of type casting:-
# -> Explicit Typecasting:- The conversion of one data type to other data type,done via developer or programmer's intervention or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit typecasting
# Below is the example of explicit typecasting

String = "15"
number = 3
String_number = int(String)

sum = number+String_number
print("Sum is: ",sum)

# -> Implicit Typecasting:- In this, method, Python converts the datatype into another datatype automatically. Users donâ€™t have to involve in this process.  

# Python automatically converts
# a to int
a = 7
print(type(a))
 
# Python automatically converts
# b to float
b = 3.0
print(type(b))
 
# Python automatically converts
# c to float as it is a float addition
c = a + b
print(c)
print(type(c))
 
# Python automatically converts
# d to float as it is a float multiplication
d = a * b
print(d)
print(type(d))
