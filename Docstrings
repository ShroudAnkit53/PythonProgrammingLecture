# 'PEP' stands for Python Enhancement Proposal
# PEP 8 written by Guido van Rossum,Barry Warsaw and Nick Coghlan

# The Zen of Python:-
# Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL’s guiding principles for Python’s design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.
# 1.Beautiful is better than ugly.
# 2.Explicit is better than implicit.
# 3.Simple is better than complex.
# 4.Complex is better than complicated.
# 5.Flat is better than nested.
# 6.Sparse is better than dense.
# 7.Readability counts.
# 8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# 9.Although practicality beats purity.
# 10.Errors should never pass silently.
# 11.Unless explicitly silenced.
# 12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# 13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# 14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# 15.Now is better than never.
# 16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
# 17.If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# 18.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# 19.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
