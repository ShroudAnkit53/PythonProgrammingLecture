# Create a simple Snake,water and gun game. It is very similar to the game Rock,paper and scissors.
# Here, the rules are:-
# if user shows snake and computer shows water, then snake will drink water and snake wins and vice-versa.
# if user shows snake and computer shows gun, then gun will kill the snake and gun wins and vice-versa.
# if user shows water and computer shows gun, then water will damage the gun and water wins and vice-versa.
import random

possible_actions = ["snake", "water", "gun"]
computer_action = random.choice(possible_actions)
print(f"\nYou chose {user_action}, computer chose {computer_action}.\n")

if user_action == computer_action:
    print(f"Both players selected {user_action}. It's a tie!")
elif user_action == "snake":
    if computer_action == "water":
        print("Snake drank water! You win!")
    else:
        print("Gun killed snake! You lose.")
elif user_action == "water":
