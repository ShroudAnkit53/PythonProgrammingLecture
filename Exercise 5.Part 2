# Create a simple Snake,water and gun game. It is very similar to the game Rock,paper and scissors.
# Here, the rules are:-
# if user shows snake and computer shows water, then snake will drink water and snake wins and vice-versa.
# if user shows snake and computer shows gun, then gun will kill the snake and gun wins and vice-versa.
# if user shows water and computer shows gun, then water will damage the gun and water wins and vice-versa.
