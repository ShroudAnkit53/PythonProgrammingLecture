# Loops in python:- 
# 1. for loop 
# 2. while loop

# 1.for loops:- 
name = "Ankit"
for i in name:
    print(i)

colours = ["Red","Green","Yellow","Blue"]
for x in colours:
    print(x)
    for i in x:
        print(i)
    if(x == "Green"):
        print("This colour is my favourite colour")

for k in range(6):
    print(k)

for k in range(0,200):
    print(k+1)

# Small Exercise:- Print multiplication table of 5
a = int(input("Enter number for which you want to find out the multiplication table:"))
print("The multiplication table of",a,"is:-")
for b in range(1,11):
    print(a,"x",b,"=",a*b)

# 2.while loops:-
a = 3
while(a<=10):  
    print(a)
    a+=1       # It is an incrementing while loop

a =10
while(a>=0):
    print(a)
    a-=1       # It is a decrementing while loop
