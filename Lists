# Python Lists:-
# 1. Lists are ordered collection of data items.
# 2. They store multiple items in a single variable.
# 3. List items are separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets[].
# 4. Lists are changeable meaning we can alter them after creation
# 5. In Java, we used to have Array.Here, in Python, similarly lists works as an array.

l = [3 , 5 , 8]
print(l)
print(type(l))

# Let's take an example of list of containing marks out of 20 of 5 students.
marks = [20 , 13 , 17 , 9 , 11]
print(marks)
print(type(marks))
print(marks[0])
print(marks[3])
# print(marks[5])  Here, it will show error that index is out of range

print(marks[-3])   # Negative indexing
print(marks[len(marks)-3])   # Simple way to convert negative indexing to positive indexing
print(marks[5-3])
print(marks[2])

# E.g Check whether a given item is present in list or not
marks = [23,24,15,18,9,2,29,30,9,20]
if 9 in marks:
  print("Yes, it is present")
else:
  print("No, it is not present")

# E.g printing elements within a given particular range
animals = ["cat","dog","elephant","tiger","lion","zebra"]
print(animals[:])
print(animals[1:])
print(animals[1:-1]) # -1 = len(animals)-1 = 6-1 = 5 animals[1:5]

# Jump concept
A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print(A[:])
print(A[1:8])
print(A[1:8:3]) # last 3 indicate that's it jumps 3 times

# List comprehension
# -> List comprehension are used for creating new lists from other iterables like lists,tuples,dictionaries,sets and even in arrays and strings
lst = [i for i in range(5)]
print(lst)
lst = [i*i for i in range(5)]
print(lst)
lst = [i*i for i in range(20) if i%2==0]
print(lst)
