# Python Tuples:-
# -> Tuples are ordered collection of data items.They store multiple items in a single variable.Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets().
     Tuples are unchangeable meaning we can't alter them after creation.

tup = (1,3,5)
print(type(tup), tup)
print(tup[2])
print(tup[-1]) # It is equal to tup[2] #negative indexing

A = (1)  # It will show class int.To show class tuple you have to use commas
print(type(A), A)
A = (1,)
print(type(A), A)

# Check for item
country = ("Germany","India","Belgium","Argentina","Australia","England")
if "Germany" in country:
    print("Germany is present")
else:
    print("Germany is not present")
print(len(country))
country2 = country[1:4]
print(country2)
