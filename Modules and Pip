# Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our python program. These are two types of modules in python:-
# -> Built in Modules:- These Modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter there is no need to install such modules explicity
# -> External Modules:- These Modules are imported from a third partyfile or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda.Since this code is written by someone else, 
we can install different versions of a same module with time.
