# f-strings in Python:-
# When we prefix the string with the letter "f", the string becomes f-string itself. The f-string can be formatted in much same as the str.format() method. The f-string offers a convenient way to embed Python expression inside string literals for formatting

A = "Hey my name is {} and I am from {}"
name = "Ankit"
country = "India"
print(A.format(name, country))
print(f"Hey my name is {name} and I am from {country}")

B = "For only {price:.2f} dollars"  # Output = 49.10
print(B.format(price = 49.0999))

price = 49.0999
B = f"For only {price:.3f} dollars"  # Output = 49.100
print(B)
