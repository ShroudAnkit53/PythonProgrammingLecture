# Like in Java,C,C++ we use switch statements,Similarly we use 'match' case

# Let's take an example of which number is divisible by 4 and what remainder it leaves
A = int(input("What's your number ?"))
B = A%4
if B==0:
    print("Remainder is: 0")
elif B==1:
    print("Remainder is: 1")
elif B==2:
    print("Remainder is: 2")
elif B==3:
    print("Remainder is: 3")

match B:
    case 0: # If remainder is 
        print("The number",A,"is divisible by 4 and leaves remainder 0")
    case 1: # If remainder is 1
        print("The number",A,"is not divisible by 4 and leaves remainder 1") 
    case 2: # If remainder is 2
        print("The number",A,"is not divisible by 4 and leaves remainder 2") 
    case 3: # If remainder is 3
        print("The number",A,"is not divisible by 4 and leaves remainder 3")
    case _:
        print("Nothing!!")
