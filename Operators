# Operators we are familiar with Mathematics about addition, subtraction etc.. Similarly, here also we can use that operators
# -> '+' means additon. Example:- 15+7
# -> '-' means subtarction. Example:- 15-7
# -> '*' means multiplication. Example:- 15*7
# -> '/' means divison. Example:- 15/7
# -> '%' means modulus. Example:- 15%7
# -> '//' means floor divison. Example:- 15//7 Here it will give the floor value
# -> '**' means exponential. Example:- 15**7 means 15 to the power of 7

# Create a simple calculator using above operators

# Below code is the first way of writing by using def function

a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

def main():
    print("Result of Addition of 2 numbers is: "+str(addition(a,b)))
    print("Result of Subtraction of 2 numbers is: "+str(subtraction(a,b)))
    print("Result of Multiplication of 2 numbers is: "+str(multiplication(a,b)))
    print("Result of Division of 2 numbers is: "+str(division(a,b)))
    print("Result of Modulus of 2 numbers is: "+str(modulus(a,b)))
    print("Result of Floor Division is: "+str(floor_division(a,b)))
    print("Result of Exponential of 2 numbers is: "+str(exponential(a,b)))

def addition(a,b):
    return a+b
def subtraction(a,b):
    return a-b
def multiplication(a,b):
    return a*b
def division(a,b):
    return a/b
def modulus(a,b):
    return a%b
def floor_division(a,b):
    return a//b
def exponential(a,b):
    return a**b

main()

# Now below code is another way of writing. We use the direct method

a = int(input("\nEnter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Result of Addition of 2 numbers is: ",a+b)
print("Result of Subtraction of 2 numbers is: ",a-b)
print("Result of Multiplication of 2 numbers is: ",a*b)
print("Result of Division of 2 numbers is: ",a/b)
print("Result of Modulus of 2 numbers is:",a%b)
print("Result of Floor Division is: ",a//b)
print("Result of Exponential of 2 numbers is: ",a**b)
