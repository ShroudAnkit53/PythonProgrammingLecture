# There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short.

# Example
a = int(input("Enter first number:"))
b = int(input("Enter second number:"))
print(a) if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print(b)
# Here it is divided into 3 statements :-
# 1. print(a) if a > b
# 2. else print("=") if a == b
# 3. else print(b) if a < b

# It is also a convenient way of if-else statements
