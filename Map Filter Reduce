# Map:-
# The map function applies a function to each element in a sequence and returns a new sequence containing the transformed elements. The map function has the following syntax:
# ..... map(function, iterable)

def cube(x):
    return x ** 3

print(cube(3))

l = [1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3] # List of numbers
# First way:-
newl = []
for item in l:
    newl.append(cube(item))

print(newl)

# Second Way:-
newl = list(map(cube, l))   # Map function
print(newl)

# Filter:-
# The filter function filters a sequence of elements based on a given predicate(a function that returns a boolean value) and returns a new sequence containing only the elements that meet the predicate/condition.The filter function has the following syntax:-
# ..... filter(predicate, iterable)

l = [2, 5, 9, 3, 7] # List of numbers
def filter_function(a):
    return a > 4

newl = list(filter(filter_function, l)) # Filter function
print(newl)

# Reduce:-
# The reduce function is a higher-order function that applies a function to a sequence and returns a single value.It is a part of the functions module in Python and has the following syntax:-
# ..... reduce(function, iterable)

from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # List of numbers

def mysum(x,y):
    return x+y

sum = reduce(mysum, numbers)

print(sum)
