# Exception Handling:-
# It is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception Handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing and without this process,exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

# Exceptions in Python:-
# Python has many built-in exceptions that are raised when your program encounters an error(something in the program goes wrong)

# First example
try:
    num = int(input("Enter index: "))
    a=[5,6,7]
    print(a[num])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

# Second example
try:
    num = int(input("Enter an integer"))
    print("Entered value is an integer")
except ValueError:
    print("Entered value is not an integer")

# Third Example
a = int(input("Enter number for which you want the multiplication table: "))
# If we use string input and don't use try and except then it will halt the code and stop there
print(f"Multiplication table of {a} is: ")
try:
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(f"{int(a)} X i = {int(a)*i}")
except:
    print("Invalid input!!")
