when an object of a class is created.

class Person:

    def __init__(self, n , o , s):  # Created a constructor
       self.Name = n
       self.Occupation = o
       self.Salary = s

    def info(self):
        print(f"{self.Name} is a {self.Occupation} earns {self.Salary}")

a = Person("Ankit","Developer",65000)
