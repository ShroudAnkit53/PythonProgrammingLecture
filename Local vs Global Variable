# Local and Global Variable:-

# -> A variable is a named location in a memory that stores a value.In Python,we can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =. For example :
# x = 5
# y = "Hello World!!"

# Local Variable -> A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created when the function is called and is destroyed when the function returns.

# Global Variable -> On the other hand, a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of a function and is accessible from within any function in your code.

x = 4    # This x = 4 is global variable 
# print(x) -> It will print the same

def hello():
    x = 6    # This x = 6 is local variable of function hello()
    y = 3
    print(f"The local x is {x}")   
    print("Hello World!!")

print(f"The global x is {x}")
hello()
# print(y) -> Here, it will show error as y = 3 is local variable and just like a property of hello().It can be only printed inside the hello()

# Use of 'Global' keyword
x = 10 # Global Variable

def number():
    global x
    x = 4
    y = 5
    print(y)

number()
print(x) # Here,it will print 4 as x = 4 become global now
